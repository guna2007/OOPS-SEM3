ChronoCore — Progress Tracker

- Module 1 (Core Interfaces): Implemented and Verified ✅ — headers compile cleanly via verify_module1 TU. All interfaces have pure virtuals and virtual destructors in namespace chrono_core.
- Module 2 (Task Hierarchy): Implemented and Verified ✅ — compiled and ran \_verify_module2 producing expected console output.
- Module 3 (Scheduler Hierarchy): Implemented and Verified ✅ — FIFO, Priority, RoundRobin, and Hybrid strategies compiled and ran. Output shows correct ordering and operator< usage.
- Module 4 (Resource System): Implemented and Verified ✅ — allocation/release logs printed; template ResourcePool works.
- Module 5 (Event System): Implemented and Verified ✅ — observers receive events when task state changes.
- Module 6 (Utilities): Implemented and Verified ✅ — Logger<T>, factories, and operator overloads tested.
- Module 7 (Engine): Implemented and Verified ✅ — singleton engine orchestrates modules.
- Module 8 (Main Driver): Implemented and Verified ✅ — full simulation run outputs lifecycle and events

Notes

- CMake not found in current shell; used g++ (MinGW) to compile the verification program.
